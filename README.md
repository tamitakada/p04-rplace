## Description
My Space is a replica of [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) but with a 10 second timer (for easier demo). It's a place for users to work together or against each other on a collaborative art canvas where. There exists a 10 second timer for limiting a single user or group of users from dominating the whole canvas, allowing everyone to be a part of the artwork.
